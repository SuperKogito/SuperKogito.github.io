I was born and raised in Tunisia. I grew up near in a small town near Monastir.
Since an early age I had a the passion of breaking down toys and trying to figure them out.
My first code lines were in pascal in high-school, which I graduated with honor and was granted a scholarship for engineering studies in Germany.
Since 2012 I live in Munich (Germany) and study electrical engineering at the Technical University of Munich. Iâ€™m a big fan of sports, and very interested in programming and cyber-culture.
