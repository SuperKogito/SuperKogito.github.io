   * - `Zorch`_
     - Zorch implements the basic deep learning concepts in the Zig programming language.
   * - `fastft`_
     - Fastft aims to provide a Short Time Fourier Transform implementation similar to Python's Librosa implementation in C. The STFT is demoed in a machine learning example (e.g. Mean Opinion Score Neural Network).
   * - `Spafe`_
     - spafe aims to simplify features extractions from mono audio files. The library can extract of the following features: BFCC, LFCC, LPC, LPCC, MFCC, IMFCC, MSRCC, NGCC, PNCC, PSRCC, PLP, RPLP, Frequency-stats etc. It also provides various filterbank modules (Mel, Bark and Gammatone filterbanks) and other spectral statistics.
   * - `Pydiogment`_
     - Pydiogment aims to simplify audio augmentation. It generates multiple audio files based on a starting mono audio file. The library can generates files with higher speed, slower, and different tones etc.
