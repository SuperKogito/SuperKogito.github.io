I hate to talking about myself, hence I figured that; instead of writing an obnoxious self centered essay, I should just provide some bullet points summarizing my journey so far:

- Born and raised in Tunisia |:tunisia:|.
- My first lines of code were in `Turbo Pascal`_ in high-school.
- Graduated high-school with honours (2012).
- Was granted a scholarship for engineering studies in Germany |:germany:|.
- Studied electrical engineering at the |:classical_building:| `Technical University of Munich`_.
- Have a `B.Sc.`_ (2017) and `M.Sc.`_ (2019) in electrical engineering.
- Based in Munich, at the moment.
- Machine Learning Engineer @ `Yoummday GmbH`_.
- My hobbies are sports üèÄ‚öΩüèì and programming |:computer:|.


Here is a reasonably up-to-date curriculum vitae:
