This first blog is a quick introduction of my profile, and motives to start a blog.
In this post I will be answering the following questions:

Who Am I?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Born and raised in Tunisia, based in Germany since 2012.
I am a student at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where I am pursuing a Master's degree in electrical engineering.
My fields of expertise include telecommunications & media technology, embedded security, data processing and software development.

Why Am I Blogging?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Documentation is sadly a neglected concept, it is one of those notions that everyone agrees on its importance but very few are properly doing it.
So in a way, this blog is a documentation of my work on various electrical engineering topics and a small display of my skills for interested companies.
Furthermore, I hope that other people will find value in the presented topics and that these small contributions will be useful for their projects.

What AM I Going To Be Blogging About?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At this stage, I do not want to limit the range of subjects but essentially I will be writing about what I know best and that is electrical engineering related topics.
So the blog will be a collection of small articles about embedded security, media technology etc.
It will also include some small tutorials and intros on machine learning and data processing, which I hope to be useful for those who are trying to get in those fields.

Who Am I Writing For?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As stated above, the blog is destined to help people working on similar topics.
The aim is to give a compact intros and quick tutorials to people who prefer a hands on approach to learning and problem solving.

How Can We Get Involved?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I value feedback and discussions, so constructive feedback is always welcome. The same goes for questions.
Although I cannot promise quick responses as I have a life and other responsibilities, but I will take the feedback in consideration and improve the blog accordingly.
I will also try to answer every question to the best of my knowledge.
