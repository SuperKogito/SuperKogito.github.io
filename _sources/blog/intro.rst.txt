In this first blog I will answer to the following questions:
    1. Who Are You?
    2. Why Are You Blogging?
    3. What Are You Going To Be Blogging About?
    4. Who Are You Writing For?
    5. How Can We Get Involved?


1. Who Are You?
    Born and raised in Tunisia, based in Germany since 2012.
    I am a student at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where I am pursuing a Master's degree in electrical engineering.
    My fields of expertise include telecommunications & media technology, embedded security, data processing and software development.

2. Why Are You Blogging?
    Documentation is sadly a neglected concept, it is one of those notions that everyone agrees on its importance but very few are properly doing it.
    So in a way, this blog is a documentation of my work on various electrical engineering topics and a small display of my skills for interested companies.
    Furthermore, I hope that other people will find value in the presented topics and that these small contributions will be useful for their projects.

3. What Are You Going To Be Blogging About?
    At this stage, I do not want to limit the range of subjects but essentially I will be writing about what I know best and that is electrical engineering related topics.
    So the blog will be a collection of small articles about embedded security, media technology etc.
    It will also include some small tutorials and intros on machine learning and data processing, which I hope to be useful for those who are trying to get in those fields.

4. Who Are You Writing For?
    As stated above, the blog is destined to help people working on similar topics.
    The aim is to give a compact intros and quick tutorials to people who prefer a hands on approach to learning and problem solving.

5. How Can We Get Involved?
    I value feedback and discussions, so constructive feedback is always welcome. The same goes for questions.
    Although I cannot promise quick responses as I have a life and other responsibilities, but I will take the feedback in consideration and improve the blog accordingly.
    I will also try to answer every question to the best of my knowledge.

    - Questions and feedback should be sent to :email:`AyoubMalek's blog <superkogito@gmail.com>`
