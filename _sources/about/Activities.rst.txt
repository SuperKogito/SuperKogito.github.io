--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a mentor of the MIX Program (Mentoring for International Exchange Students), I was assigned two exchange students, whom I assisted at their time at the TUM.
This included answering questions about student life in Germany and introducing the Münchner-Student lifestyle.
This pleasant experience strengthened both my foreign language skills as well as my inter-cultural competence.
