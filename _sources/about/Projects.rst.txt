Gui-port scanner
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| 03 June, 2018

----------------------------------------

After reading some Stackoverflow questions, I got interested in ports scanning.
So after some coding, I ended up developing a gui- port scanner using python3 and the tkinter library.
The code simply iterates through a range of ports targeting a specified IP, tries to establish a socket connection and returns whether the port is open or not.
The project can be found under the following link:

Cryptos

| 30 October, 2017

----------------------------------------

I recently finished working on a small project that I called Cryptos. Cryptos is a small gui encryption and hashing tool built with python 3.
The GUI is based on the tkinter library and includes various menu-bar functionalities.
The data encryption & decryption is done using AES-128 (Advanced Encryption Standard), whereas the hashing is generated using the SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm).
The project can be found under the following link:

Ludwigskollg Website
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
| 30 January, 2015

----------------------------------------

As I lived in the Ludwigkolleg dorm, I was invested in its small community, with whom I shared a lot of great memories and took part on various common activities such as football games, movie nights, and parties.
On top of all, I was also responsible for designing the current dorm webpage.
As an admin I had joy in designing the webpage layout, refine its context and include the needed wordpress modules and widgets.
The outcome of my work can be seen under:
