I was born and raised in Tunisia. I grew up in a small town near Monastir.
Since an early age I had a passion for breaking down toys and trying to figure them out.
My first lines of code were in pascal in high-school, which I graduated with honor and was granted a scholarship for engineering studies in Germany.
I studied electrical engineering at the Technical University of Munich, which I graduated from in the summer of 2019.
Currently, I am based in Munich and work as a machine learning engineer @Yoummday GmbH.
Iâ€™m a big fan of sports, and very interested in programming and cyber-culture.
