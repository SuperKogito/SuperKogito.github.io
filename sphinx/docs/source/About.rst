About
=====
My name is Ayoub Malek; I was born on 24.06.1993 in Tunisia. I grew up near Monastir (Tunisia), where I graduated from high-school with honor and was granted a scholarship for engineering studies in Germany.
Since 2012 I live in Munich (Germany) and study electrical engineering at the Technical University of Munich. I’m a big fan of sports, and very interested in programming and cyber-culture.
