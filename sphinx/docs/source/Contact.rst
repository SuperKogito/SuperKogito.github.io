Motivation
~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to ensure that only authorized agents can access protected resources, a personal unique identification
system must be put in place.  However, keys and passwords, despite their utility are easily lost, stolen, or counterfeited.
Furthermore, an agent simple identity claim using a username and password set is proven to be insufficient and none
practical in avoiding the access sharing of one agent's account. Hence, an identity verification
mechanism is needed.
